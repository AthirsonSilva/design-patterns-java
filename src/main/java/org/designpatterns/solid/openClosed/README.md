## Open-Closed principle

The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) states that software entities (classes, modules, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to extend the functionality of a module without modifying its existing code. This is achieved through techniques like abstraction with interfaces or abstract classes.
