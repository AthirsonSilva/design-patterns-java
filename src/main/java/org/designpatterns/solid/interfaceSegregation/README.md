## Interface segregation principle

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use. This means interfaces should be created with specific client needs in mind, promoting loose coupling and making the system easier to maintain. By using smaller, more specific interfaces, different client classes can depend only on the functionality they actually need.
