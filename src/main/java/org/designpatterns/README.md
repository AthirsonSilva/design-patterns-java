## Types of design patterns

There are three main categories of design patterns, each focusing on a different aspect of software design:

`Creational Patterns`: These patterns deal with how objects are created in a controlled way. They provide flexibility and reusability in object creation. Common examples include Singleton (ensures only one instance of a class exists) and Factory Method (creates objects without specifying the exact class).

`Structural Patterns`: These patterns focus on the composition of classes and objects. They help you achieve a more flexible and efficient class structure. Some popular structural patterns include Adapter (allows incompatible interfaces to work together) and Facade (provides a simplified interface to a complex system).f

`Behavioral Patterns`: These patterns define communication patterns between objects. They help objects collaborate and achieve a specific behavior. Examples include Observer (allows objects to be notified of changes win other objects) and Strategy (allows changing an object's behavior at runtime).
